                The Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curve, as we can see plots the true positive rate (recall) on the y â€“ axis and the false positive rate (probability of false alarm â€“ FP / (TN +FP) on the x-axis.
                The Area Under the Curve (AUC) is a way to quantify a modelâ€™s ROC curve, by calculating the total area under it, 
                a metric that falls between zero and one, with a higher number meaning better classification performance. As we can see above, 
                the AUC metric for the Farfalla class curve is greater, meaning that it can achieve a better blend of precision and recall, 
                as we saw in the confusion matrix too. Generally, all the classes have a similar (low) false positive rate, but they differ on their true positive rate.
